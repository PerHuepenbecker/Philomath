# Dataset Management and Machine Learning in C

This project demonstrates a dataset management system and basic machine learning algorithms implemented in C without relying on any libraries except libc. It includes functions for initializing, managing, and manipulating datasets, as well as implementing linear regression and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms.

For me this was a C refresher and a personal learning project parallel to  a machine learning module at university. Because of personal
time restrictions i was not able to complete the library with all intended features by now. 

I'm still looking forward to continue my work here. I generally feel that implementing from scratch gives you much better understanding of a topic. 

## Features
- Dataset handling
- Error handling using a custom `Result` type
- Functions for reading datasets from CSV files
- Normalization of datasets
- Linear regression implementation
- Multidimensional linear regression
- K-nearest neighbors (KNN) implementation
- KNN regression and classification
- Unit tests to validate functionality

## Wishlist

- Refactoring
- More machine learning algorithms (e.g. k-means, basic neural network)
- Better test coverage
- ...
